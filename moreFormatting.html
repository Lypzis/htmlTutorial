        And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin.
        Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number
        thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt
        thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed 
        to three. Five is right out. Once at the number three, being the third number 
        to be reached, then, lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards 
        thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.'

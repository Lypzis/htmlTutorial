        Orbitting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two millions miles
        is an <b>utterly insignificant</b> little blue-green planet whose 
        ape-descended life forms are so <b>amazingly primitive</b> that they still
        think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

        Only six people in the <i>entire Galaxy</i> understood the principle
        on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once 
        Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was
        more or less a <i>fait accompli</i>: he was ideal presidency fodder.

        On the day of the <u>Great On-Turning</u> two soberly dressed programmers
        with briefcases arrived and were shown descreetly into the office.
        They were aware that this day they would represent <u>their entire race</u>
        in it's greatest moment.

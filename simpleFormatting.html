        Orbitting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two millions miles
        is an <b>utterly insignificant</b> little blue-green planet whose 
        ape-descended life forms are so <b>amazingly primitive</b> that they still
        think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

        Only six people in the <i>entire Galaxy</i> understood the principle
        on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once 
        Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was
        more or less a <i>fait accompli</i>: he was ideal presidency fodder.

        On the day of the <u>Great On-Turning</u> two soberly dressed programmers
        with briefcases arrived and were shown descreetly into the office.
        They were aware that this day they would represent <u>their entire race</u>

        There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack
        lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a 
        nice day, <sub>[The HitchHikers Guide to the Galaxy]</sub> suggests, 
        and try it.

        got anything to say yet and shut it again.

        His brain then <b><u>started to contend</b></u> with the problem of what
        his eyes told it they were looking at, but in doing so relinquished control
        of the mouth which promptly fell open again. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once more gathering up the jaw, <b>his brain <u>lost control</b>
        of his left hand</u> which then wandered around in an aimless fashion.
